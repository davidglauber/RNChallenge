Hello everyone, everything good?


## Running the app

To run the project just do a git clone and then install the dependencies


## What I did to make the project

- React Native
- Redux
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- React Hook Form
- Prettier
- React Navigation
- Expo Modules
- More (you can check on package.json)


## Miscellaneous

Due to the cost of the Macbook in my country, I was unable to test the app on iOS but I guarantee that I did my best to ensure compatibility was perfect on both operating systems.
